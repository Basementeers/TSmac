**TSmac is a fork of Tarmac! TSmac adds support for generating Typescript files, for use with Roblox-TS. The original Tarmac repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Roblox)!**

Tarmac is a resource compiler and asset manager for Roblox projects. It helps enable hermetic place builds when used with tools like [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo).

Tarmac is inspired by projects like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) that make it easy to reference assets from code.

## Installation

### Installing with Foreman
The recommended way to install TSmac is with [Foreman](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/foreman).

Add an entry to the `[tools]` section of your `foreman.toml` file:

```toml
tsmac = { source = "void-starred/TSmac", version = "0.7.0" }
```

### Installing from GitHub Releases
Pre-built binaries are available for 64-bit Windows, macOS, and Linux from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Basementeers/TSmac/releases).

### Installing from Source
TSmac requires Rust 1.39.0 or newer to build.

You can build the latest release of Tarmac from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install tsmac
```

or build the latest work from the master branch:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/void-starred/TSmac
```

## Basic Example
**The [examples](examples) folder contains small, working projects using different features from Tarmac.**

TSmac is configured by a [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file in the root of a project named `tsmac.toml`. TSmac uses this file to determine where to look for assets and what to do with them.

To tell TSmac to manage PNG files in a folder named `assets`, you can use:

```toml
name = "basic-tarmac-example"

# Most projects will define some 'inputs'.
# This tells Tarmac where to find assets that we'll use in our game.
[[inputs]]
glob = "assets/**/*.png"
codegen = true
codegen-path = "src/assets.ts"
codegen-base-path = "assets"
```

Run `tsmac sync --target roblox` to have TSmac upload any new or updated assets that your project depends on. You may need to pass a `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie explicitly via the `--auth` argument.

TSmac will generate Lua code in `src/assets.ts` that looks something like this:

```ts
// This file was @generated by TSmac. It is not intended for manual editing.
export = {
	foo: {
		bar: "rbxassetid://238549023",
		baz: "rbxassetid://238549024",
	}
}
```

These files will be turned into `ModuleScript` instances by tools like [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo). From there, it's easy to load this module and reference the assets within:

```ts
import assets from "src/assets.ts";

const decal = new Instance("Decal");
decal.Texture = assets.foo.bar;
```

## Command Line Interface
For more information, run `tsmac --help`.

### Global Options
These options can be specified alongside any subcommands and are all optional.

* `--help`, `-h`
	* Prints help information about TSmac and exits.
* `--version`, `-V`
	* Prints version information about TSmac and exits.
* `--auth <cookie>`
	* Explicitly defines the authentication cookie TSmac should use to communicate with Roblox.
	* If not specified, TSmac will attempt to locate one from the local system.
* `--verbose`, `-v`
	* Enables more verbose logging. Can be specified up to three times, which will increase verbosity further.

### `tsmac sync`
Detects changes to assets in the local project and attempts to synchronize them with an external service, like the Roblox cloud.

Usage:
```bash
tsmac sync [<config-path>] \
	--target <roblox|debug|none>
	--retry <number>
	--retry-delay <60>
```

To sync the project in your current working directory with the Roblox cloud, use:
```bash
tsmac sync --target roblox
```

To validate that all inputs are already synced, use the `none` target:
```bash
tsmac sync --target none
```

When TSmac gets rate limited while syncing to Roblox, use the `--retry` argument to automatically attempt to re-upload. This will tell TSmac how many times it can attempt to re-upload each asset. The `--retry-delay` sets the number of seconds to wait between each attempt.
```bash
tsmac sync --target roblox --retry 3
```

### `tsmac upload-image`
Uploads a single image as a decal and prints the ID of the resulting image asset to stdout.

Usage:
```bash
tsmac upload-image <image-path> \
	--name <asset-name> \
	--description <asset-description>
```

Example:
```bash
tsmac upload-image foo.png --name "Foo" --description "Foo is a placeholder name."
```

### `tsmac asset-list`
Outputs a list of all of the asset IDs referenced by the project. Each ID is separated by a newline.

Usage:
```bash
tsmac asset-list [<config-path>] \
	--output <file-path>
```

Example:
```bash
tsmac asset-list --output asset-list.txt
```

### `tsmac create-cache-map`
Creates a mapping from asset IDs back to their source files. Also downloads packaged images to a given folder, generating links to those assets as well.

The mapping file is JSON.

Usage:
```bash
tsmac create-cache-map [<config-path>] \
	--index-file <file-path> \
	--cache-dir <cache-folder>
```

Example:
```bash
tsmac create-cache-map --index-file assets.json --cache-dir asset-cache
```

### `tsmac help`
Prints help information about Tarmac itself, or the given subcommand.

Usage:
```bash
tsmac help [<subcommand>]
```

## Project Format
* `name`, string
	* The name of the TSmac project, used in logging and error reporting.
* `max-spritesheet-size`, (int, int), **optional**
	* The maximum spritesheet size that TSmac should use. Defaults to **(1024, 1024)**, the maximum image size supported by Roblox.
* `asset-cache-path`, path, **optional**
	* If defined, TSmac will re-download uploaded images to a local folder at the given path. Files in this folder not associated with assets in the project will be deleted.
* `asset-list-path`, path, **optional**
	* If defined, TSmac will write a list of asset URLs used by the project to the given file. One URL is printed per line.
* `upload-to-group-id`, int, **optional**
	* If defined, TSmac will attempt to upload all assets to the given Roblox Group. If unable, syncing will fail.
* `inputs`, list\<InputConfig\>, **optional**
	* A list of inputs that TSmac will process.
* `includes`, list\<path\>, **optional**
	* A list of additional paths to search recursively for additional projects in. The inputs from discovered projects will be merged into this project, and other settings ignored.
	* When a `tsmac.toml` file is found, TSmac will include it and its includes and stop traversing that directory.

### InputConfig
* `glob`, string
	* A path glob that should include any files for this input group.
	* TSmac uses the [globset library](https://docs.rs/globset/0.4.5/globset/) and supports any syntax it supports.
* `codegen`, bool, **optional**
	* Whether TSmac should generate Typescript code for the assets contained in this input group. Defaults to **false**.
* `codegen-path`, path, **optional**
	* If defined and `codegen` is true, TSmac will merge all generated Typescript code for this input group into a single file.
* `codegen-base-path`, path, **optional**
	* Defines the base path for generating Typescript code when `codegen-path` is also defined. Defaults to **the directory containing `tarmac.toml`**.
